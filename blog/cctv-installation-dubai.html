    <h2>1. Choose the Right Type of Camera</h2>
    <p>Bullet cameras are great for outdoor use, while dome cameras are discreet and suited for indoor environments. Consider your location’s needs before picking a type.</p>

    <h2>2. Understand the Legal Requirements</h2>
    <p>In Dubai, CCTV installation must comply with local regulations. Always use approved vendors and avoid installing cameras in private or restricted areas.</p>

    <h2>3. Optimize Camera Placement</h2>
    <p>Install cameras at entry points, parking lots, server rooms, and hallways. Avoid direct sunlight or glare, and make sure no blind spots are left uncovered.</p>

    <h2>4. Choose the Right Storage Option</h2>
    <p>Decide between cloud or local storage based on your internet connectivity, budget, and data sensitivity. Hybrid systems offer both options.</p>

    <h2>5. Schedule Regular Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Dust, heat, or power issues can impact performance. Plan quarterly checkups and software updates to ensure your system always works.</p>
